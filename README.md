# Flappy-Bird
Hey there, this is a project I was working in Android Studio. a detailed explanation is attached below.

Detailed explanation:
The game has three screens.
Opening screen - selecting the level of the game (it is possible to jump between the screens)
Instructions screen - Explain how to play and the purpose of the game
Game screen - This is where the game itself takes place, at the top of the page are the points of the current round and the the best record ever of points.
